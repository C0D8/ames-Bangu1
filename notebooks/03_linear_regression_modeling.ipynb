    "Now that we have the data all cleaned, and all the missing values accounted for, lets focus on transforming the data for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets remember what a model is. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A predictive model is a **set** of functions that receive data as input and produce a prediction, that is, an estimate of the target value as output.\n",
    "- **Train** a model is to search the set of candidate functions for one that adequately represents the **training dataset**.\n",
    "- The adequacy of a candidate function to the training data is usually determined by a **loss function** that measures how well the predictions of the function match the real values of the target within the training dataset. It is common to define a *loss function per data item* (e.g. absolute error, quadratic error, etc) and to construct the *loss function over the dataset* as the *average prediction loss*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many models are **parametric models**. In this case, each function of the set of functions that makes the model is constructed from a vector of **parameters** that define the function, forming a **parametric function**. For instance: the linear model constructs prediction values out of a linear combination of the input features, plus a constant. The weights of the linear combination plus the constant are the parameters of the model. The set of functions that can be represented by this model is given by all possible values of the vector of parameters that define the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some models are called **non-parametric models**. These models usually do not have a parametric form (like the linear model). But the terminology is a bit misleading, though: usually these models *do* have parameters, and potentially an open-ended set of them! For instance, consider the \"decision tree\" model, which is one of the most prominent models of this category. The decision tree may not have a formula for the predicted value, but it does have parameters, many of them: each decision in the tree involves a choice of feature and a threshold level, and those choices must be stored as parameters of the model for use in future predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model has specific requirements for the format of the input data. Most of the time, the minimum requirement is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All columns are numeric;\n",
    "- There are no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some models have extra requirements. For example: the support-vector-machines model requires that the input features have comparable standard deviations - having features that have large discrepancies between features in terms of their order of magnitude (such as a feature in the fractions of unit range and another in the tens of thousands) will result in poor prediction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "And some models may not have any special requirement at all. We will study each of those in detail in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start our study with a simple model: the *multivariate linear regression* model. This is a model that presents the minimum requirements listed above. So we need to do a bit of processing on the original features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Numerical features* stay as given;\n",
    "- *Categorical features* have to be transformed into numerical features. In order to do so we need to **encode** these features, that is: to transform them into new features that convey the same information, but in a numerical form, and in a way that \"makes sense\" - we'll see it below.\n",
    "- *Ordinal features* can be transformed into numerical features in the same way as the caegorical features, or could be assigned increasing numbers in conformity with the ordered nature of the categories of the feature."

For instance, you can run hypothesis tests on the values of the parameters to determine whether they refute the null hypothesis $\\theta_i = 0$ with a given statistical significance level.
